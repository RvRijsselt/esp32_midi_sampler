# Sinterklaassurprise 2021
## Dear Stella & Gea,

> These last years were challenging really,  
> Even now we can’t always breathe freely.  
> Grateful that celebrations can go through  
> We’re happy to be together anew.

> St. Nicholas never stopped spying  
> The results were very satisfying.  
> Watching your busy lives was never tiring,  
> In fact it was amazingly inspiring.

> He watched your every activity  
> And was influenced by your creativity  
> To combine handicraft and fine arts  
> To integrate music and spare parts

> He collected some fabric, glue and nails   
> Visited instrument builders’ yard sales  
> Borrowed materials from an artist’s workshop  
> And added a touch of ornithology on top.

> Strings, wings and artsy things built in  
> We proudly present … The Cuculin!

___St. Nicholas and assistants___


>PS.  
>> No need to destroy the Cuculin  
>> The gift you search is not within.  
>> Play some music, hopefully pleasant    
>> Elsewhere you will find the present.
